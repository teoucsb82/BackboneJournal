# BackboneJournal App

## Written in Backbone.js, this app was written in 1-day as an exercise in Backbone functionality. 

Main page allows users to create and delete posts via AJAX (through Backbone) to allow nearly instant page rendering.

To demo, clone the repo, `rake db:migrate` and load the rails server.
